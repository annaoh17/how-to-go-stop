            <span>Before playing, decide if you want to play with chips, money, or nothing at all.</span>
            <span> If you choose to play with chips, the number can vary depending on your preferences, the rules you've set, and the number of rounds you have decided to play. 
                The goal is to accumulate the most points and chips to win the game! </span>
            <span>If you prefer to play with money, that is entirely up to you and how you want to gamble. However, please be mindful when gambling. This option is not one I recommend!</span>
            <span>If you decide to play for points only, then keep on reading!</span>
